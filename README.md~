# PBO: Probability of Backtest Overfitting 

One of the most challenging problems in machine learning is the assessment of a model's ability to generalize to unseen data. For applications in finance, this is made particularly acute by the sequential nature of the data and the failure of many standard cross-validation techniques to deal with long range dependence. 

Any trading strategy built on overfitted models puts the firm's capital and the manager's reputation at risk. Thus, the field of financial machine learning is in great need of techniques to assess the generalization capability of learning algorithms. 

In Bailey et al[1], they take the approach that a model's performance should be consistent in any
subset of the training-validation pairs. By evaluating every combination of these pairs, one could 
quantify empirically the degree (probability) that a model trained on historic data is overfitted (backtest overfitting).

This is a R implementation of their algorithm, separately described in a recent book[2]. The variable names follows the notation in Chapter 11 of said book. 

# Installation
To install directly from github, open a terminal, type R, then

    devtools::install_github('htso/PBO')

# Dependencies
You need the following packages. To install from a terminal, type 

    install.packages("gtools", "foreach", "parallel")

# Tutorial

Let's start with a simple example and see how to use the functions in this package to compute the probability of overfitting.

The typical case is that you think you've found a neat algorithm to make step-ahead forecast after searching through a long history of stock prices. The training procedure that landed you the final model depends on a couple of hyperparameters. After extensive grid search, you found the optimal combination of these hyperparamters. (Don't worry about the multiple testing issue for now -- although that's a major problem with this approach.) 

At each attempt to find a better model, you run through all the data you have, beginning in 1980-01-01 and ending in 2018-09-11.

# WARNING
As in many other combinatoric problems, the scale of computation and memory requirement grow exponentially with the number of partitions. It is recommended that S be set to no more than 20. 

# Platforms
Developed and tested on Linux (ubuntu 14.04), R 3.4.4.
